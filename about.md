title: About
---

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [algebra
group](https://math.as.uky.edu/algebra-and-number-theory) at the
University of Kentucky, where I work with [Uwe
Nagel](https://math.as.uky.edu/users/urnage2) on problems in
computational mathematics and commutative algebra. I am currently on
the job market.

Before coming to the University of Kentucky, I went to graduate school
at the [University of Illinois](https://math.illinois.edu/) where I
worked with [Hal
Schenck](https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/schenck) and
finished my [PhD](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/97758) in 2017. I earned
a BA in Computer Science and Mathematics at Wesleyan University in
2010.

I am interested in using domain-specific programming languages to
tackle problems in pure mathematics, and in using pure mathematics to
make improvements to computational software. I have experience with
[Macaulay2](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/),
[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), and
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/), as well as
[python](https://numpy.org/) with
[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/),
[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

I was a TA for calculus I, II and III at the University of Illinois
for eleven semesters between 2010 and 2017. I also won a [teaching
award](https://conf.math.illinois.edu/GraduateProgram/department-ta-award.html)
there.
