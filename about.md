title: About
---

I am a mathematician working in guidance, navigation and control analysis.

Between 2017 and 2022 I was a postdoctoral scholar and then a lecturer
in the [algebra
group](https://math.as.uky.edu/algebra-and-number-theory) at the
University of Kentucky, where I worked with [Uwe
Nagel](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~uwenagel/) on problems in computational
and commutative algebra.

Before coming to the University of Kentucky, I did my graduate work at
the [University of Illinois](https://math.illinois.edu/) where I
worked with [Hal
Schenck](https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/schenck) and
finished my [PhD](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/97758) in 2017. I earned
my BA in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Wesleyan
University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/) in 2010.

I am interested in problems at the intersection of mathematics,
statistics and computation. I also like using mathematics to improve
computational software. I have experience with
[Macaulay2](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/),
[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), and
[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/), as well as [Python](python.org/)
with [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/),
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) and
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

I was a TA for calculus I, II and III at the University of Illinois
for eleven semesters between 2010 and 2017. I also won a [teaching
award](https://conf.math.illinois.edu/GraduateProgram/department-ta-award.html)
there.
