I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [algebra group](https://math.as.uky.edu/algebra-and-number-theory) at the University of Kentucky, where I work with [Uwe Nagel](https://math.as.uky.edu/users/urnage2) on problems in computational mathematics and commutative algebra. I am currently on the job market.
