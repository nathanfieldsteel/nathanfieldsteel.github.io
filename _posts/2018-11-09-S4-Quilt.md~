title: Visualizing normal subgroups in S<sub>4</sub>
---

The [Math Lab](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/) at the University of
Kentucky has a group which visualizes mathematical ideas through
quilting, with
[projects](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/search/label/2d%20Visualization)
involving partitions, hyperbolic tilings, and prime sieves. One idea
for a quilting project, originally suggested by [Dave
Jensen](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~dhje223/), was to create a quilt
representing the Cayley table for the symmetric group \\(S_4\\) to
exhibit its flag of normal subgroups. This post is about an
implementation of that idea using Mathematica.

The [symmetric group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group)
\\(S_4\\) is the group of bijective functions from the set \\(\lbrace
1,2,3,4 \rbrace\\) to itself. It has an index \\(2\\) normal subgroup
\\(A_4\\) consisting of only the even permutations, and contained in
\\(A_4\\) is the Klein \\(4\\)-group \\(V\\) generated by products of
disjoint \\(2\\)-cycles. Taken together this describes a flag of
normal subgroups in \\(S_4\\)

\\[ (1) \\trianglelefteq V \\trianglelefteq A_4 \\trianglelefteq S_4\\]

To work with these permutation groups in Mathematica, all we need to know is that \\(S_n\\) can be generated by any \\(2\\)-cycle and any \\(n\\)-cycle,\\(A_4\\) can be generated by \\((123)\\) and \\((124)\\), and \\(V\\) is generated by any two of its non-identity elements.
