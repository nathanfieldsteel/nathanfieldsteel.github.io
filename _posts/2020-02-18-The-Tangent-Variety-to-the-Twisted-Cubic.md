title: The Tangent Variety to the Twisted Cubic
---

The [twisted cubic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_cubic)
is a famous example (and counterexample) in algebraic geometry, usually described parametrically as image of the map \\(\vec{r} : \mathbb{P}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^3\\) given by

\\[ \vec{r}([s:t]) = [s^3, s^2 t, s t^2, t^3],\\]

though typically for visualization purposes, we'll restrict our
attention to the affine patch where \\(s \not = 0\\), where we have
the more familiar parametrization \\(\vec{r} : \mathbb{R}^1
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\\) given by

\\[\vec{r}(t) = (t, t^2, t^3).\\]

Sean Grate and I were thinking about several ideas for a 3D printed
object that demonstrates something about the twisted cubic.
