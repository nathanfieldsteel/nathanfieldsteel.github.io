title: The Tangent Variety to the Twisted Cubic
---

The [twisted cubic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_cubic)
is a famous example (and counterexample) in algebraic geometry, usually described parametrically as image of the map \\(\vec{r} : \mathbb{P}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^3\\) given by

\\[ \vec{r}([s:t]) = [s^3, s^2 t, s t^2, t^3],\\]

though typically for visualization purposes, we'll restrict our
attention to the affine patch where \\(s \not = 0\\), where we have
the more familiar parametrization \\(\vec{r} : \mathbb{R}^1
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\\) given by

\\[\vec{r}(t) = (t, t^2, t^3).\\]

Sean Grate and I were thinking about several ideas for a 3D printed
object that demonstrates something about the twisted cubic. We
initially had plans to make a two-piece model showing the tangent
variety to the twisted cubic sliced in half with a hyperplane section,
so that the cross-section is a tri-cuspidal quartic curve. This turns
out to be extremely difficult to do in the real locus without actually
separating the tangent variety into three or more pieces, some of them
quite small. So we've shelved that idea for now, and we're currently
working on printing a model of the tangent variety to the twisted
cubic which accentuates the fact that it's a union of lines tangent to
the curve itself.
