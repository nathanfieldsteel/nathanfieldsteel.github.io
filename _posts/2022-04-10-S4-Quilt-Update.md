Some time ago, I wrote [a post]({% post_url 2018-11-09-S4-Quilt %}) about visualizing the maximal normal series of the permutation group \\(S_4\\) in a Cayley table, using a carefully-chosen ordering and coloring of its elements. From 2019 to the end of 2020, the [UK Math Lab](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/)'s 2D visualization group was making steady progress on a quilt based on that design. To read their progress updates, see [here](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/2020/05/progress-on-symmetric-group-quilt.html), [here](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/2020/07/more-progress-on-symmetric-group-quilt.html) and [here](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/2020/11/the-symmetric-group-quilt-is-almost-done.html). And you can see the finished result [here](https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/2020/12/the-symmetric-group-quilt-is-done.html) along with a discussion of the design. Below is the image from my 2018 post and a picture of the finished quilt from 2020.

In 2021, [Kate Ponto](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~kate/) (who was the driving force behind organizing the group that managed to finish this project during a pandemic) submitted the quilt to the [exhibition of mathematical art](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2022-joint-mathematics-meetings) at the [JMM](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm). It was just announced that the quilt was awarded an [honorable mention](https://twitter.com/JointMath/status/1512852856918970370) at the exhibition.
