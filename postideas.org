* proving conway's circle theorem with M2 (or with a finite check?)

* books I would like (recommendations from dataset)


** break it into three posts:
1. raw numbers ""counting"),
2. matrix factorization, and
3. "machine learning"


* web scrape jstris data, visualize. maybe use R?

* tetrio optimized combos

* lean theorem prover?

* langton's ant

* R markdown post


Next up:

1. visualize book data
2. circle theorem
3. matrix factorization book data
4. tetris optimization
5. deep learning book data
